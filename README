This is the directory for standard heliocentric code HERMIT4.
Routines for direct integration of all bodies are in dir Direct,
together with a test input file.
To use this version, first compile standard code, then go to
dir Direct and do 'gfortran -O3 -c *.f', followed by moving the
object files to dir Hermit4 and do another 'make hermit4'.
Note that the energy errors are slightly worse (with more steps)
so a small reduction of ETA is recommended.
